        Hi
      </span>
      ,I’m Rajib Sardar, a web developer specializing in Tailwind CSS, React,
      JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, Next.js, and Node.js. My journey into
      programming started with a simple curiosity about web development, which
      evolved into a deep passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly
      interfaces. I enjoy transforming ideas into clean, functional designs that
      provide seamless user experiences. Outside of coding, I love reading
      books, exploring new concepts, and traveling, especially to the mountains
      where I recharge and find inspiration. I’m always excited to learn, grow,
      and tackle new challenges—both professionally and personally. Let’s
      connect and create something amazing together! ersonally. Let&apos;s
